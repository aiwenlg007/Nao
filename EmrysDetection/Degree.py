# This test demonstrates how to use the ALLandMarkDetection module.
# Note that you might not have this module depending on your distribution
#
#  /!\  Please change the IP address with your robot IP.
#
# - We first instantiate a proxy to the ALLandMarkDetection module
#     Note that this module should be loaded on the robot's naoqi.
#     The module output its results in ALMemory in a variable
#     called "LandmarkDetected"

# - We then read this ALMemory value and check whether we get
#   interesting things.
